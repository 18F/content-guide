Plain language is mandatory for [all federal government
websites](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/). One of the aspects of
this most people pick up on is the **plain English list,** which is
below.

This isn’t just a list of words to avoid; it’s a way of writing.

U.S. government websites are for everyone. The content they contain
should therefore be as straightforward and clear as possible.

**Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do.** Use
_buy_ instead of _purchase_, _help_ instead of _assist_, _about_ instead
of _approximately_, and so on.

We lose our users’ trust if we write using government buzzwords and
jargon. Often, these words are too general and vague and can lead to
misinterpretation or empty, meaningless text. We can do without these
words:

-   Agenda (unless you’re talking about a meeting)

-   Advancing

-   Collaborate (use *working with*)

-   Combating (use *working against* or *fighting*)

-   Commit/pledge (we need to be more specific — we’re either doing something or we’re not)

-   Countering

-   Deploy (unless you’re talking about the military or software)

-   Dialogue (we speak to people)

-   Disincentivize (and incentivize)

-   Empower

-   Facilitate (instead, say something specific about *how* you are helping)

-   Focusing

-   Foster (unless it's children)

-   Illegals/illegal aliens (use *undocumented immigrants*)

-   Impact (as a verb)

-   Initiate

-   Innovative (use words that describe the positive outcome of the innovation)

-   Key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing isn’t “key” — it’s probably important)

-   Land (as a verb. Only use if you’re talking about aircraft)

-   Leverage (unless you use it in the financial sense)

-   Overarching

-   Progress (what are you actually doing?)

-   Promote (unless you are talking about an ad campaign or some other marketing promotion)

-   Robust

-   Simple/simply (use *straightforward*, *uncomplicated*, or *clear*, or leave the descriptor out altogether)

-   Streamline

-   Strengthening (unless you’re referring to bridges or other structures)

-   Tackling (unless you’re referring to football or another contact sport)

-   Thought leader (refer to a person’s accomplishments)

-   Touchpoint (mention specific system components)

-   Transforming (what are you actually doing to change it?)

-   User testing (unless you’re actually testing the users — otherwise, use *usability testing*)

-   Utilize

Avoid using figurative language — it often doesn’t say what you actually
mean and can make your content more difficult to understand. For
example:

-   Drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)

-   Drive out (unless it's cattle)

-   Going forward (unless you’re giving directions)

-   In order to (this is superfluous — don’t use it)

-   One-stop shop (we’re the government, not a big box store)

In most cases, you can avoid these figures of speech by describing what
you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.

Write conversationally. Picture your audience and write as if you were
talking to them one-on-one and with the authority of someone who can
actively help.
