Bulleted lists should adhere to the following guidelines: Capitalize the first word of every bullet. Include a period at the end of the bullet only if that point is a complete sentence. See the examples below.

*When you go to the store, please buy:*

-   *Apples*

-   *Bananas*

-   *Naan chips*

*When you leave the house:*

-   *Please buy apples, bananas, and naan chips.*

-   *Fill the car with gas.*

**Colons:** Capitalize the first word after a colon, only if what
follows is a complete sentence. See the examples below.

*I have several favorite genres: poetry, fiction, and nonfiction.*

*I have several favorite genres: Poetry is my first love, but nonfiction
is a rising star in my life.*

**Commas:** We prefer the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford
comma). In a list of three or more, include a comma before the
conjunction. For example: *Please buy apples, bananas, and naan chips.*

**Dates** should include full month name. For example, *December 14,
1954.*

**Dashes:** When offsetting a phrase with dashes you should use the
longer em dash (—), which is Option+Shift+- on Macs, with a space on
either side of the dash. For example:

*We emphasize open, digital record keeping, and — whenever possible — we
illuminate our processes.*

**Quotes:** Below are examples of correctly punctuated quotations.

*“Would you like a banana?” he asked.*

*“I hate bananas,” she said. “You know I hate bananas.”*

*He paused before saying “bananas are not something people should
hate.”*
