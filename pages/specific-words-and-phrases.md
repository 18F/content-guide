Below are rules for how 18F uses common words and phrases, in
alphabetical order. The bold term shows the accepted form
(capitalization, hyphenation, punctuation), with accompanying text
explaining usage. Examples appear in italics.

-   18F employees are *18F team members* or *18F staffers*. Avoid all iterations of “18F-r.”

**A**

-   **ages** - avoid hyphens in ages unless it clarifies the text. For example, *a group of 9 18-year-old White House tourists*

-   **agile**

-   **and**, never “&” or “+,” unless part of an official title. For example, *D.C. Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day*

**B**

-   **back end**, **back end development**

**D**

-   **D.C.**, not "DC"

**E**

-   **email**, not "e-mail"


**F**

-   **federal government**, not "Federal Government" or "Federal government"

-   **federal**, unless part of a proper noun. For example, *Federal Bureau of Investigation*

-   **front end**, **front end development**

-   **full stack**, **full stack development**

**G**

-   **GitHub**

-   **government**, unless part of a proper noun. For example, *Government Printing Office*

**I**

-   “Info” is a conversational shortening of “information.” In formal situations, use the full word.

**N**

-   Numbers - Spell out *one* to *nine*. Use numerals for numbers 10 or greater. This is true of ordinal numbers as well. Spell out *first* to *ninth*, and capture *10th* or greater with numerals. Sometimes the government writes about very large numbers: millions, billions, even trillions. We express these numbers with a numeral and a word. For example, *1.6 million people* or *5 billion dollars*. 

**O**

-   **open source**, **open source software**

**P**

-   **percent** is preferred to *%*. For example, *10 percent of respondents*.

**S**

-   Slash - avoid using /. Replace it with words.

-   **startup**

-   States:

    -   Spell out names. For example, *Mississippi*

    -   Used alone, “state” should be lowercase. For example, *all 50 states responded*.

    -   When used with a city, spell out the name of the state.

**T**

-   “Tech” is an informal shortening of “technology.” In formal situations, use the full word.

-   Titles - don't capitalize titles unless they precede a name. For example, *the director got approval* or *Director Lopez got approval*. Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral. For example, we prefer *firefighter* to *fireman* and *chairperson* to *chairman*.

**U**

-   **United States government** or **U.S. government**, not "U.S. Government"

-   **U.S.**, not "US" or "USA"

**W**

-   **wi-fi**
