Below are rules for how 18F uses common words and phrases, in
alphabetical order. The bold term shows the accepted form
(capitalization, hyphenation, punctuation), with accompanying text
explaining usage. Examples appear in italics.


**0-9**

-   18F employees are **18F team members** or **18F staffers**. Avoid all iterations of 18F-r.


**A**

-   **ages**, avoid hyphens in ages unless it clarifies the text. For example, *a group of 10 18-year-old White House tourists*

-   **agile**


-   **and**, never & or +, unless part of an official title. For example, *D.C. Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day*

**B**

-   **back end**, **back end development**

**D**

-   **D.C.**, not "DC"

**E**

-   **email**, not "e-mail"


**F**


-   **federal**, unless part of a proper noun. For example, *Federal Bureau of Investigation*



-   **federal government** (not Federal Government or Federal government)

**G**

-   **GitHub**
-   **government**, unless part of a proper noun. For example, *Government Printing Office*

**H**

-   **human-centered design**

**I**


-   “Info” is an acceptable conversational shortening of “information.” In formal situations, use the full word.


**N**


-   Numbers - Spell out *one* to *nine*. Use numerals for numbers 10 or greater. This is true of ordinal numbers as well. Spell out *first* to *ninth*, and capture *10th* or greater with numerals. Sometimes the government writes about very large numbers: millions, billions, even trillions. We express these numbers with a numeral and a word. For example, *1.6 million people* or *5 billion dollars*.

**O**

-   **open source**, **open source software**

**P**


-   **percent** is preferred more than the “%” symbol. For example, *10 percent of respondents cited. . .*


**S**

-   Slash - avoid using the “/” symbol. Replace the symbol with words.


-   **startup**

-   States:

    -   Spell out names. For example, *Mississippi*

    -   Used alone, “state” should be lowercase. For example, *all 50 states responded*.

    -   When used with a city, spell out the name of the state.

**T**

-   “Tech” is an acceptable informal shortening of “technology.” In formal situations, use the full word.

-   Titles — don't capitalize titles unless they precede a name. For example, *the director got approval* or *Director Lopez got approval*. Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral. For example, we prefer *firefighter* to *fireman* and *chairperson* to *chairman*.

**U**

-   **United States government** or **U.S. government**, not "U.S. Government"

-   **U.S.**, not US or USA

-   **user-centered design**

**W**

-   **Wi-Fi**
