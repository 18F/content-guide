title: Be concise
---
To keep content understandable, concise and relevant, it should be:

-   Specific

-   Informative

-   Clear and concise

-   Brisk but not terse

-   Incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and
    > unnecessary words) but human (not something generated by a
    > faceless machine)

-   Serious but not pompous or emotionless—adjectives can be subjective
    > and make the text sound more emotive and like spin

You should:

-   Use contractions (such as can’t and won’t)

-   Not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar – for example, say *You
    > can* rather than *You may be able to*

-   Use the language people are using

-   Use [*Google
    > *](https://www.google.com/trends)[*Trends*](https://www.google.com/trends)
    > to check for common search terms

-   Use short sentences

-   Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them
    > for clarity

Words ending in –ion and –ment tend to make sentences longer and more
complicated than they need to be. Avoid also turning verbs into nouns,
another common sign of government-ese at work.
