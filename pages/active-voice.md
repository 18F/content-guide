**Avoid passive verb tenses whenever possible.** The
active voice makes content easier to understand because
the reader can more easily identify who the subject
performing the action is. It makes written content more 
engaging, too.

Example old: *When the process of freeing a vehicle that has been stuck
results in ruts or holes, that rut or hole must be filled.*

Example new: *If you make a hole while freeing a stuck vehicle, you must
fill the hole before driving away.*
