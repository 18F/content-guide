title: Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
---
FAQs are bad. We don't like them. **If you write content by starting
with user needs, you won’t need to use FAQs.**

Frequently asked questions usually aren’t questions asked by the reader,
but rather are important information dumped in the FAQ section by the
content editor. In most cases, FAQ content is not where users expect to
find it, which makes users’ experience frustrating and less than
informative.

If you find yourself contemplating an FAQ, instead consider going to the
places in your website that are generating questions and rethinking how
you can alter that content or design to solve the question. Or provide
an answer in the context of the user experience so that users don’t have
to navigate to an additional page to find the answer.

If you receive many of the same types of inquires via email, take note
that your users are identifying for you a gap in your content. Pay
attention and correct this content gap as quickly as you can.
