**Acronyms can confuse readers. Whenever possible, use the full name.**

If an acronym is necessary for future reference, write out the full name
and follow with the abbreviation in parentheses. For example, *The
General Services Administration (GSA)*.

Some acronyms are more recognizable abbreviated than not. For example,
*NASA*, *NAACP*, *FBI*. In such instances, the acronym is always
acceptable, at the writer’s discretion.

At the writer’s discretion, refer to organizations on second reference
with a shortened name instead of an acronym. For example, use *Labor* in
place of *Department of Labor*, rather than *DOL.*
