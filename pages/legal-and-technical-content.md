title: Publishing legal and technical content
---
**Present legal content in plain language**. It's important that we
present complicated information simply to increase the likelihood people
will understand it.

A rule of thumb: If you must include legal jargon, make sure you also
write a short, plain-language summary to go along with it. Where
evidence shows there's a clear user need for including a legal term,
always explain it in plain language.

Use technical terms when necessary. They're not jargon â€” you
need only explain what they mean the first time you reference them.

If you are publishing the source code for a project, the
[18F Open Source Style Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/)
can help you make the project easy to use and understand.
