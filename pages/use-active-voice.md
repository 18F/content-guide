Active voice
----------------

**Avoid passive voice, whenever possible.** The
active voice allows the reader to more easily identify each sentenceâ€™s
subject (and makes written content more engaging, too).

Example old: *When the process of freeing a vehicle that has been stuck
results in ruts or holes, that rut or hole must be filled.*

Example new: *If you make a hole while freeing a stuck vehicle, you must
fill the hole before driving away.*
