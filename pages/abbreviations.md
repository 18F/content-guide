**Abbreviations can confuse readers. Spell the words whenever possible.**

If an abbreviation is necessary for future reference, spell the full word
and follow with the abbreviation in parentheses. For example, *The
General Services Administration (GSA)*.

Some abbreviations are more recognizable than their full spellings. For example,
*NASA*, *NAACP*, *FBI*. In such instances, the abbreviation is always
acceptable at the writer’s discretion.

At the writer’s discretion, refer to organizations on second reference
with a shortened name instead of an abbreviation. For example, use *Labor* in
place of *Department of Labor*, rather than *DOL.*
