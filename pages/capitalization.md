**Follow a consistent capitalization scheme**. Creating trustworthy
internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the
content’s consistency. Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations
undermine our narrative authority. Unnecessary capitalization can also
come off as overly formal and unapproachable. We follow these
capitalization guidelines:

-   Don't capitalize “agile,” unless it is the first word of a sentence

-   Don't capitalize “open source,” unless it is the first word of a sentence

-   Don't capitalize “federal” or “government”

See additional capitalization rules in the [Specific words and phrases](https://pages.18f.gov/content-style-guide/specific-words-and-phrases/)
section.

**Headings:** Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content
should follow sentence case. For example:

*Making sense of Washington’s tech landscape*

*Privileges and responsibilities*
