**Follow a consistent capitalization scheme**. Creating trustworthy internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the content’s consistency. Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations undermine your narrative authority. We follow these capitalization guidelines:

- Don't capitalize “agile,” unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don't capitalize “open source,” unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Don't capitalize “federal” or “government”

When you're deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind that in English, title case is often a marker of formality. Using it judiciously can help clarify that you're speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a form, office, or person). Overuse can cause users stress by implying formality or officialness where it doesn't exist. For instance:

- It makes sense to capitalize the phrase "Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return" because you want users to know the exact, official title of that specific form.
- It could confuse users to capitalize "income taxes" or "income tax forms," because those phrases could refer to any number of possible forms.

See additional capitalization rules in the [Specific words and phrases](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/specific-words-and-phrases/)
section.

## Headings

Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content should follow sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon. For example:

*Making sense of Washington’s tech landscape*

*Privileges and responsibilities*
