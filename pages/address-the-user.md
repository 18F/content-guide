**Address the user as “you” wherever possible.** Content on government
sites often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get
involved or take action, for example, *You can contact 18F at this email
address* or *Learn more about starting your MyRA account*.

If you’re creating content that addresses multiple users — for example,
a patient and their caregiver — address the nominal user as “you” and
refer to the additional users by their roles or titles.
