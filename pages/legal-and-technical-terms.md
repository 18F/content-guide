title: Legal and technical terms
---

Present complicated information clearly so it’s easier to understand.

If you need to include legal jargon, make sure you also write a short, plain-language summary to go along with it. Where evidence shows there’s a clear user need for including a legal term, always explain it in plain language.

Use technical terms when necessary. They're not jargon — you need only explain what they mean the first time you reference them.

If you’re publishing the source code for a project, the [18F Open Source Style Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/) can help you make the project easy to use and understand.
