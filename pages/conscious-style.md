We aim to empower and include all users. To that end, we adhere to the
[*conscious style guide*](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) whenever we
can.

**Gender:** Ensure text is gender neutral, wherever possible. Use
*them*, *their*, *they*. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender
bias â€” for example, lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.

**Age:** We prefer *older person* or *senior* to *elderly*.
