We follow the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/)
because we are inclusive of all users.

**Gender:** Ensure text is gender neutral wherever possible. Use
*them*, *their*, and *they*. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender
bias â€” for example, lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.

**Age:** We prefer *older person* or *senior* to *elderly*.
