We aim to empower and include all users. To that end, we adhere to the
[*conscious style guide*](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) whenever we
can.

- Age: We prefer **older person** or **senior** to elderly.

- Citizen: Avoid using citizen as a generic term for people who live inside the U.S. Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses. Use **public** when possible. 

- Gender: Ensure text is gender neutral, wherever possible. Use
**them**, **their**, **they**. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender
bias — for example, lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.
