We follow the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) because we are inclusive of all users.

- Age: We prefer **older person** or **senior** to elderly.

- Nationality: Avoid using **citizen** as a generic term for people who live inside the U.S. Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses. Use **public** when possible.

- Gender: Ensure text is gender neutral, wherever possible. Use **they**, **them**, and **their**. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias â€” for example, lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.
