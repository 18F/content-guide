## 18F Content Guide

This is the repository for the [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/). This guide was developed for 18F employees, but we hope it's a useful reference for everyone.

For a detailed introduction, see [how to use this guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/).

## History

18F's Content Guild ([#g-content](https://18f.slack.com/archives/g-content)) maintains this guide.

We started by adapting [GOV.UK’s work](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design), and we’d like to thank their team for championing plain language and information accessibility. We've since expanded the guide to cover more topics, reorganized things, and moved the site from 18F Pages to [Federalist](https://github.com/18F/federalist/). This guide is a work in progress, and we'll continue refining it over time.
