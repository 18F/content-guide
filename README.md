# 18F Content Guide

18F content designers and strategists join cross-functional teams to collaboratively improve user experiences across government. This guide is here to help us get the job done. It’s neither a step-by-step tutorial nor a set of rules. Instead, it’s a starting point for 18F-led content design: doing it, discussing it, and ensuring it’s done to a consistent level of quality.
