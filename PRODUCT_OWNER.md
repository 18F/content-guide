# 18F UX Guide Product Owner 

The product owner's primary responsibilities are to (1) ensure that that the guide continues to evolve in alignment with the needs of its users and (2) scope and prioritize guide-related work and make sure that it gets done. 

In addition, the 18F UX Guide Product Owner is expected to spend an average of one-two hours a week working towards the following objectives (in collaboration with the UX supervisor, as appropriate):


## Objective A: Ensure the guide reflects the team’s current practices

- Plan for and moderate guide-related meetings with the UX team supervisor, as appropriate (for example, facilitate exercises during the team’s bi-weekly huddle)
- Drive consensus around the UX team’s preferred practices (for example, through things like collaboratively drafting articles and managing a peer review process)


## Objective B: Ensure the guide supports the team’s current practices

- Interview new hires on the UX team a few weeks after their start date to understand what’s intuitive / not about the UX team’s practices
- Work with the 18F Chief of Projects to understand what new content (project-related, guide-related, etc.), if any, would better support 18F UX designers
- Create and curate reusable UX resources: templates, case studies, checklists, etc.
- Address outstanding issues in GitHub


## Objective C: Ensure the guide works as part of GSA’s content ecosystem
- Work with outreach to ensure content and site get all necesary approvals
- Ensure site is on brand 
- Meet with the product owner for 18F’s Methods as needed to ensure mutually supportive content
- Work with the co-leads of the TTS Research Guild to facilitate annual updates to GSA’s Privacy Impact Assessment for Design Research
- Elevate the guide as an 18F product
