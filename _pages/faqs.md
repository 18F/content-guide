title: Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
---
Like our peers at GDS, we [strongly discourage writing FAQs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#dont-use-faqs), or Frequently Asked Questions.

FAQs:

* Are hard to read and search for
* Duplicate other content on your site
* Are usually not questions asked by the public
* Mean that content is not where people expect to find it—it needs to be in context

If you’re thinking about posting FAQs, review the related content on your site and look for ways to improve it. For example:

* Is it organized in a logical way?
* Can you group similar topics together?
* Is it easy to find?
* Is it clear and up-to-date?

If people are asking similar questions, the existing content isn’t meeting their needs. Perhaps you need to rewrite it or combine several pieces of content. Pay attention to what users are asking for and find the best way to guide them through the process.
