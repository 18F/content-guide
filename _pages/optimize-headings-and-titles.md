title: Optimize headings and titles
---
Most people start their search for information with a search engine. If
they can't find your page, they won't be reading your content.

To help users find your content, you'll have to use the vocabulary they
use, and that starts with your page title, summary, and first paragraph.

Use search tools like [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/)
to compare different versions of headings to see which will be more
effective. What you're calling the subject of your page might not be
what your users are calling it. With Google Trends, you can input two
or more different words or phrases and see over time how often people
have searched for them. Generally, it’s best to use whichever phrase is
used more often in your heading.

For example, an interior page on the [U.S. EITI
site](https://useiti.doi.gov/sectors/) is titled “U.S. Natural Resource
Sectors.” Before naming a page like this, you should compare the phrase
“natural resources” to similar phrases like “natural deposits.” A[
Google Trend search comparing those two
phrases,](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Natural%20resources%2C%20Natural%20deposits&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4)
shows that “natural resources” is a much more popular search term.

Once you know the most popular keywords, you can prioritize them in:

-   Titles
-   Headings
-   Introductions and summaries
-   Chapter and section titles
-   Metadata descriptions
