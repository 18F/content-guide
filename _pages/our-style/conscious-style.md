title: Inclusive language
---
In our personal and professional lives, the words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance. As we build government services, we want to ensure that they are accessible and welcoming to all users. Inclusive language is a powerful tool for making users feel welcome and helping them understand their options.

This guide is influenced by the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/), which is an excellent resource for learning more about the conversations behind terms, categories, and concepts. Other resources we used:

- [Diversity Style Guide](http://www.diversitystyleguide.com/)
- [Disability Language Style Guide](http://ncdj.org/style-guide/)
- [Associated Press Stylebook](http://www.apstylebook.com/)
- [Syracuse University Disability Cultural Center Language Guide](http://sudcc.syr.edu/LanguageGuide/)

This guide provides suggestions for word choice and phrasing when writing and talking about diverse groups of people.

## Age

Avoid referring to someone’s age, unless it’s relevant to what we’re writing about (for example, when referring to benefits that are available to people of certain ages).

If necessary, we prefer _older person_ or _senior_ to _elderly_.

## Sexuality and gender

Make content gender neutral wherever possible, and strive to write in a [gender-fair](http://www.ncte.org/positions/statements/genderfairuseoflang) way. If you’re writing about a hypothetical person or if you’re unsure of the person’s pronouns, use _they_ or _them_ instead of _he/she_.

Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as irrelevant descriptions of appearance.

Use descriptors of gender identity or sexual orientation as modifiers, not as nouns (for example, _transgender person_, _cisgender person_, or _lesbian woman_). Avoid guessing sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. When in doubt, either reconsider the need to include this information or ask the person you’re referring to how they identify and what terms they prefer.

Notes on specific words:

- Use _different sex_ instead of _opposite sex_ (because this recognizes gender as a spectrum, rather than a binary).
- We support using _they_ or _their_ as singular pronouns.
- Avoid _guys_ as a way to refer to mixed-gender groups.
- Don't make assumptions about marital or family relationships (for example, use _spouse_ or _partner_ instead of _husband_ and _wife_; use _parent_ instead of _mother_ and _father_).

For more detailed guidance on terms related to sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, see the [National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association Style Guide](http://www.nlgja.org/stylebook/terminology/) or the [GLAAD Media Reference Guide](https://www.glaad.org/reference/).

## Nationality

Avoid using _citizen_ as a generic term for people who live in the United States. Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses.

How you refer to the public is largely dependent on context. Feel free to choose from any of these words:

* People
* The public
* Users
* Folks

Be as specific as possible. Depending on the situation, you may want to say something like "people who need healthcare" or "people who need to access government services online."

Use _citizens_ for information related to U.S. citizenship, for example, when describing who is eligible to vote in federal elections.

Be careful with _Americans_ or _the American public_. These terms are [ambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_United_States_citizens) and are often used as synonyms for _citizens_. In most cases, _the public_ is equally clear and more inclusive. That said, referring to _Americans_ or _the American people_ can be useful if you want to inspire readers or take a more patriotic tone.


## Gender

Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible. Use _they_, _them_, and _their_. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.

Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for _novice_ or _beginner_. For example, don’t say something is [so simple your mother can use it](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/So_simple,_your_mother_could_do_it).
