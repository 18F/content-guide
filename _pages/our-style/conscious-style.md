We follow the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) because we are inclusive of all users.

## Age

We prefer _older person_ or _senior_ to _elderly_.

## Nationality

Avoid using _citizen_ as a generic term for people who live in the United States. Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses.

How you refer to the public is largely dependent on context. Feel free to choose from any of these words:

* People
* The public
* Users
* Folks

Be as specific as possible. Depending on the situation, you may want to say something like "People who need healthcare" or "People who need to access government services online."

Use _citizens_ for information related to U.S. citizenship, such as describing who is eligible to vote in federal elections.

## Gender

Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible. Use _they_, _them_, and _their_. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.

Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for _novice_ or _beginner_. For example, don’t say something is [so simple your mother can use it](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/So_simple,_your_mother_could_do_it).
