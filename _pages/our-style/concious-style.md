We follow the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) because we are inclusive of all users.

## Age

We prefer _older person_ or _senior_ to elderly.

## Nationality

Avoid using _citizen_ as a generic term for people who live inside the U.S. Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses. Use _public_ when possible.

## Gender

Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible. Use _they_, _them_, and _their_. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.

Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for _novice_ or _beginner_. For example, don’t say something is [so simple your mother can use it](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/So_simple,_your_mother_could_do_it).
