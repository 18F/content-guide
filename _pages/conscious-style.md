title: Conscious style

We follow the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) because we are inclusive of all users.

- Age: We prefer _older person_ or _senior_ to elderly.

- Nationality: Avoid using _citizen_ as a generic term for people who live inside the U.S. Many government programs serve non-citizens and individuals with a wide range of immigration and visa statuses. Use _public_ when possible.

- Gender: Ensure text is gender neutral, wherever possible. Use _they_, _them_, and _their_. Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias â€” for example, lengthy and irrelevant descriptions of appearance.
