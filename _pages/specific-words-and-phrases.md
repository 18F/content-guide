Below are rules for how 18F uses common words and phrases, in alphabetical order. The bold term shows the accepted form
(capitalization, hyphenation, punctuation), with accompanying text explaining usage. Examples appear in italics.

**0-9**

- 18F employees are **18F team members** or **18F staffers**. Avoid all iterations of 18F-r.

- **drop-down** when used as an adjective. For example, *drop-down menu.* **drop down** when used as a noun. For example, *an option from the drop down.* Never "dropdown."

      - **log in** when used as a verb, for example, *You must log in to access your calendar.*

**N**

- Numbers - Spell out *one* to *nine*. Use numerals for numbers 10 or greater. This is true of ordinal numbers as well. Spell out *first* to *ninth*, and capture *10th* or greater with numerals. Sometimes the government writes about very large numbers: millions, billions, even trillions. We express these numbers with a numeral and a word. For example, *1.6 million people* or *5 billion dollars*.

**P**

- **percent** is preferred more than the “%” symbol. For example, *10 percent of respondents cited. . .*

- Slash - avoid using the “/” symbol. Replace the symbol with words.
- **startup**
-  States:
    -   Spell out names. For example, *Mississippi*
    -   Used alone, “state” should be lowercase. For example, *all 50 states responded*.
    -   When used with a city, spell out the name of the state.

**T**

- “Tech” is an acceptable informal shortening of “technology.” In formal situations, use the full word.
- Titles — don't capitalize titles unless they precede a name. For example, *the director got approval* or *Director Lopez got approval*. Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral. For example, we prefer *firefighter* to *fireman* and *chairperson* to *chairman*.
- Use **to do** as a noun and **to-do** as an adjective. For example, *your to dos* or *your to-do list*.

**U**

- **United States government** or **U.S. government**, not "U.S. Government"
- URLs should be lowercase, even when they appear at the start of a sentence. For example, *notalone.gov launched today*.
- **U.S.**, not US or USA
- **user-centered design**

**W**

-  **Wi-Fi**

**Y**

- Years - Use the full, four-digit year. For informal writing, it's acceptable to use an abbreviated form. For example, *We're thankful web design isn't stuck in the '90s.*
