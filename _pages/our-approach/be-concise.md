title: Be concise
---
To keep content understandable, concise, and relevant, it should be:

- Specific
- Informative
- Clear and concise
- Brisk but not terse
- Incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words) but human (not something generated by a faceless machine)
- Serious but not pompous or emotionless—adjectives can be subjective and make the text sound more emotive and like spin

You should:

- Use contractions (such as _can’t_ and _won’t_)
- Not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar (for example, say _You can_ rather than _You may be able to_)
- Use the language people are using
- Use [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends) to check for common search terms
- Use short sentences
- Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them for clarity

Words ending in *–ion* and *-ment* tend to make sentences longer and more complicated than necessary. Avoid turning verbs into nouns, a common sign of governmentese at work.
