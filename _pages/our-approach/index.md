Here at 18F, we take an approach that is based on user-centered principles, acknowledging the broad audience that government content is often addressing. The pages in this section are mostly refinements of the basic statements you find among [our principles]({{ "/our-approach/content-principles/" | relative_url }}). “Be concise,” for example, naturally follows from the principles “Do the hard work to make it simple” and “Write for everyone.”

We hope that you will find both these principles and the way we expand on them in this section helpful as you work to improve your own content.
