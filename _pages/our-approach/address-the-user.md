title: Address the user
---
Address the user as _you_ whenever possible.

Content on government sites often makes a direct appeal to the public and businesses to get involved or take action. For example, *You can contact 18F at this email address* or *Learn more about starting your MyRA account*.

If you’re creating content that addresses multiple users — for example, a patient and their caregiver — address the nominal user as “you” and refer to the additional users by their roles or titles.

## How to talk about the public

How you refer to the public is largely dependent on context. Feel free to choose from any of the words on this list: people, the public, users, or folks.

We recommend against using the word “citizens” this way. Not everyone who uses a government website is a citizen, and we shouldn’t assume that in our prose. Use “citizens” to specify information related to U.S. citizenship — for example, describing who is eligible to vote in federal elections.
