title: Address the user
---
Address the user as _you_ whenever possible.

Content on government sites often makes a direct appeal to the public and businesses to get involved or take action. For example:

> You can contact 18F at [mailto:18F@gsa.gov](18F@gsa.gov)

> Learn more about starting your MyRA account

If you’re creating content for multiple users—such as patients and their caregivers—address the primary user as _you_ and the secondary users by their roles or titles.

We recommend against using the word _citizens_ when talking about the public. See the [conscious style](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/conscious-style/#nationality) section for further guidance.
