title: Structure the content
---

Below you’ll find a few characteristics of online readers as well as our recommendations on ways to keep them in mind when writing and editing.

## Important information first

Online, users tend to scan text until they find the information they need. No matter how carefully you craft your content, most people will only read [25 percent of it](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-reading/). This statistic isn’t meant to dishearten; rather, we believe it underscores the importance of getting content right.

Put the most important information in the first two paragraphs. That’s the section users are most likely to read. In journalism, this technique is called the “inverted pyramid.”

## Break up text

Large chunks of text can overwhelm readers. Use subheads and bullet points; they provide clear narrative structure for readers in a hurry. Meanwhile, put your information-carrying words at the beginning of your sentences, and keep them in [active voice](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/active-voice/).

For example:

- Original subhead: *Looking into the regulation of campaign finances*
- Better subhead: *Campaign finance law explained*

If you’re wrangling a lot of data, tables can help you visualize that content. Long paragraphs cluttered with numbers or dates are more difficult to scan than, for example:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Report type</th>
            <th>Dates covered</th>
            <th>Due</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="4">Quarterly (Form <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3i.pdf">3</a>, <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3i.pdf#page=19">3Z</a>, <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3li.pdf">3L</a>)</td>
            <td>January 1–March 31</td>
            <td>April 15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>April 1–June 30</td>
            <td>July 15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>July 1–September 30</td>
            <td>October 15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>October 1–December 31</td>
            <td>January 31</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Keep sentences short and sweet

Craft sentences at 25 words or fewer, whenever possible. If a sentence has fewer than 14 words, [readers understand 90 percent of content](http://comprehension.prsa.org/?p=217). At 25 words, sentences are markedly more difficult to comprehend.

We also recommend varying sentence length. Switching things up helps you keep readers interested. This tactic will also give you better control of your content’s [tone](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/voice-and-tone/) — a text with only short sentences can unintentionally sound terse. The occasional longer sentence adds a bit of narrative interest (and can help a piece of writing sound friendlier, too).

Here’s an example of how you might transform a too-long sentence into something more manageable:

- Too long: *Due to privacy and logistical considerations, passes cannot be replaced if lost or stolen; a new Paper Voucher must be accessed by going to the [everykidinapark.gov](https://everykidinapark.gov/) website and completing the same activities to obtain a new Paper Voucher.*

- Easier to read: *Unfortunately, we can’t replace lost or stolen passes. Get a new pass by visiting [everykidinapark.gov](https://everykidinapark.gov/) and signing up again.*

## Don’t use FAQs

FAQs are bad. We don't like them. **If you write content by starting
with user needs, you won’t need to use FAQs.**

Frequently asked questions usually aren’t questions asked by the reader, but rather are important information dumped in the FAQ section by the content editor. In most cases, FAQ content is not where users expect to find it, which makes users’ experience frustrating and less than informative.

If you're thinking about adding FAQs, consider reviewing the content on your website that is generating questions and think about how you can change the content or design to answer the question — or provide an answer in context to prevent people from visiting an additional webpage to find the answer.

If you receive similar questions by email, take note that your users are identifying problems in your content. Pay attention to correct these problems as quickly as possible.
