title: Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
---
FAQs are bad. We don't like them. **If you write content by starting
with user needs, you won’t need to use FAQs.**

Frequently asked questions usually aren’t questions asked by the reader,
but rather are important information dumped in the FAQ section by the
content editor. In most cases, FAQ content is not where users expect to
find it, which makes users’ experience frustrating and less than
informative.

If you're thinking about adding FAQs, consider reviewing the content on
your website that is generating questions and think about how you can 
change the content or design to answer the question — or provide an 
answer in context to prevent people from visiting an additional webpage
to find the answer.

If you receive similar questions by email, take note
that your users are identifying problems in your content. Pay
attention to correct these problems as quickly as possible.
