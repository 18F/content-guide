title: Plain language
---
U.S. government websites are for everyone. The content they contain should be as straightforward as possible. One of the best ways to make content clear and usable is to use **plain language**. When we use words people understand, our content is more findable, accessible, and inclusive. [Plain language](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/) is also mandatory for all federal government websites.

When we use jargon in our writing, we risk losing users’ trust. Government, legal, business jargon are often vague or unfamiliar to users, and can lead to misinterpretation.

Another temptation that can hurt readability is figurative language: it often doesn’t say what you actually mean, and can make your content more difficult to understand. For example:

- Drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
- Drive out (unless it's cattle)
- Going forward (unless you’re giving directions)
- One-stop shop (we’re the government, not a big box store)

In most cases, you can avoid these figures of speech by describing what you’re actually doing. Be open and specific.

If you're struggling to use plain language, try writing conversationally. Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one, with the authority of someone who can actively help.

**Don’t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do.** Use _buy_ instead of _purchase_, _help_ instead of _assist_, _about_ instead of _approximately_, and so on.

**Plain English lists** can help spot problem words and consider alternatives, but keep in mind that plain language is more than just a list of words to avoid — it’s a way of writing.

Try to avoid these words when you can:

- Agenda (unless you’re talking about a meeting)
- Advancing
- Collaborate (use *working with*)
- Combating (use *working against* or *fighting*)
- Commit/pledge (we need to be more specific — we’re either doing something or we’re not)
- Countering (use *answering* or *responding*)
- Deliver (pizzas, mail, and services are delivered — not abstract concepts like improvements or priorities)
- Deploy (unless you’re talking about the military or software)
- Dialogue (we speak to people)
- Disincentivize (and incentivize)
- Empower
- Execute (use *run* or *do*)
- Facilitate (instead, say something specific about *how* you are helping)
- Focusing
- Foster (unless it's children)
- Illegals/illegal aliens (use *undocumented immigrants*)
- Impact (as a verb)
- Initiate (use *start*)
- Innovative (use words that describe the positive outcome of the innovation)
- In order to (superfluous — don’t use it)
- Key (unless it unlocks something — otherwise, use *important* or omit)
- Land (as a verb only use if you’re talking about aircraft)
- Leverage (unless you use it in the financial sense)
- Liaise (use *collaborate* or *work with*)
- Modify (use *change* instead)
- Overarching
- Progress (what are you actually doing?)
- Promote (unless you are talking about an ad campaign or some other marketing promotion)
- Robust
- Simple/simply (use *straightforward*, *uncomplicated*, or *clear*, or leave the descriptor out altogether)
- Slimming down (processes don’t diet)
- Streamline
- Strengthening (unless you’re referring to bridges or other structures)
- Tackling (unless you’re referring to football or another contact sport)
- Thought leader (refer to a person’s accomplishments)
- Touchpoint (mention specific system components)
- Transforming (what are you actually doing to change it?)
- User testing (use *user research* or *usability testing*)
- Utilize (use *use*)
