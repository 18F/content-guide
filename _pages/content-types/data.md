title: Data

Data is often represented on websites, in reports and other documents.  When done well data provide the user with a foundation through which they can begin to quantify their own understanding of particular issues or findings.  When done poorly, data can be misrepresented to lead the user to incorrect conclusions.  These guidelines will help you represent data clearly and in ways that will lead to better understanding.  

## Guidelines

### Keep it simple

When referring to specific data points, use data in the simplest, most meaningful manner possible.  When describing data or elements of data visualizations, follow standard practice.  Describe data succinctly.  Do not embellish with jargon-filled language or statements that an average user won't understand.  It is your job to describe your data correctly, not the reader's job to guess what you mean.

### Use appropriate visualizations

Select a complimentary way to visualize the data.  Your reader should be able to interpret the data correctly with a minimal amount of supporting information.

A useful technique is to ask a reader to interpret your visualization without an explanation.  If a reader has to take an inordinate amount of time to interpret the data, or cannot correctly interpret the data without help, the visualization isn't effective.

Here are some common types of visualizations, and some guidelines on how to use them.  We're going to talk about five mechanisms for representing data: tables, charts, graphs, maps and diagrams.

#### Tables (some of this comes directly from https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/technical-and-interface-writing/)
Tables are generally suitable only for data: two or more “objects” (rows) that share two or more “values” (columns). In tables, column widths are the same for all rows, which can make them easier to scan visually. Tables are easily navigable for sightless users so long as the content is organized in a logical way. Here are some other guidelines to consider:

- When listing numbers, it’s good practice to align them to the right of their cell, with the same decimal precision (“40.50” and “1.00”) so that the numbers are easier to compare while scanning.  Use of decimals should be uniform through all the records in shown in the table.
- Records can be sorted by particular columns, but this should be indicated in the design of the table.  For example, if listing cities by size of population, the title of the table and the population column should include an appropriate indicator.  
- Avoid truncating records in the data table.
- Always align column headings up with the values in the columns. For example, numeric column headings should be aligned right if the values are, too.
- Column names should correctly describe the data in the cells.  Use aliases for system-generated names when summarizing data in tables.
- Avoid using heavy table borders and shading that make the data difficult to read.  Avoid special fonts for tables.

In [this example](http://www.well-beingindex.com/2016-community-impact) from the Gallup - Healthways Well Being index, we can observe the following: 

- columns are clearly defined
- fonts are legible and contrast well with cell shading
- values are clearly ordered
- decimal lengths are consistent
- colors are uniform and intuitive (lighter cell shading is representing lower rankings)

### Links and additional resources

It’s rare that a document lives on its own. Tell people where to go for help if they have questions.
