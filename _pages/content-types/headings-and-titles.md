Most people start their search for information with a search engine. If they can't find your page, they won't be reading your content.

To help users find your content, you have to use their vocabulary and keywords, starting with your page title, summary, and first paragraph.

## Find the right keywords

Use search tools like [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/) to compare different versions of headings to see which will be more effective. What you're calling the subject of your page might not be what your users are calling it. With Google Trends, you can input two or more different words or phrases and see over time how often people have searched for them. Generally, itâ€™s best to use whichever phrase is used more often in your heading.

For example, the phrase _extractive industries_ is part of the name of the [U.S. EITI site](https://useiti.doi.gov/), but _extractive industries_ isn't a familiar term for many users (and there aren't very many searches for that term). To help make content more findable, the site includes familiar terms like _natural resources_, _fossil fuels_, and _renewable energy_ whenever possible.

A [Google Trend search](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=extractive%20industries,fossil%20fuels) shows that _natural resources_ and _fossil fuels_ are both more popular search terms. The [page about natural resource production in the U.S.](https://useiti.doi.gov/how-it-works/production/) is a great example of how those terms can be included in headers.

## Optimize the content

Once you know the most popular keywords, you can incorporate them judiciously in:

* Titles
* Headings
* Introductions and summaries
* Chapter and section titles
* Metadata descriptions
