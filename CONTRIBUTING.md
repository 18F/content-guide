## Welcome
We're glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! 

If you're unsure about anything, ask us — or submit the issue or pull request anyway. We love all friendly contributions, 
and we welcome your ideas about how to keep our Content Guide updated, friendly, and accessible.

To ensure a welcoming environment for our projects, our staff follows the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md); 
contributors should do the same. Please also check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy). 

## Adding new guidance
If you think something's missing or have an idea for an enhancement, please create an 
issue or send us a pull request. We welcome your thoughts and suggestions.

## Changing existing guidance
No one's perfect — especially not us. If you think our guide got something wrong, please let us know. 
Our process for changing the guide is as follows:

1. You'll file an issue asking for a style change. (Be sure to let us know why you made the request!)
1. Members of the content guild will discuss the proposed change and open an emoji vote on your issue. 
1. After ~5 days, our guild will close voting. We'll either implement your change or leave you a note explaining why we chose not to.
